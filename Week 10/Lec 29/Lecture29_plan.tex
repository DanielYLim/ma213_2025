    \begin{itemize}
        \item xx min Lecture: review from last time
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We should (now) be very comfortable with Z- and t-tests, and we recently learned how to compare 2 means
            \item Recall that ANOVA allows us to compare 3+ means in different levels/categories, for example in <lecture example>
            \item Review F-statistic
        \end{itemize}
        \item xx min Lecture: p-value meaning in this case (like slide 71)
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz: now with all the tools in hand, conduct an ANOVA test for the lecture example, step-by-step
        \item xx min R Demonstration: answers to the quiz in R, and review interpretation of the test results
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO1: Understand Point Estimates and Sampling Variability:} Define a sample statistic (point estimate) for a population parameter, and explain how it varies across different samples.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO3: Calculate and Interpret Standard Error:} Calculate the standard error for proportions and interpret it as a measure of sampling variability.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO4: Explain Hypothesis Testing and Its Limitations:} Discuss the use cases and potential issues with hypothesis testing, including the interpretation of results.
        \item \textbf{M3, LO6: Distinguish Statistical vs. Practical Significance:} Differentiate between statistical significance and practical significance, and explain the implications of each.
        \item \textbf{M4, LO2: Design and Interpret Confidence Intervals:} Design, execute, and interpret confidence intervals for the population proportion.
        \item \textbf{M4: LO8: Conduct and Interpret ANOVA:} Assess whether conditions for an ANOVA are met, and if so, design, execute, and interpret the test to compare sample means across several groups.
    \end{itemize}
