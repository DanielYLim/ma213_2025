\formula{p-value}
{
p-value is the probability of at least as large a ratio between the ``between group" and ``within group" variability, if in fact the means of all groups are equal. It's calculated as the area under the F curve, with degrees of freedom $df_G$ and $df_E$, above the observed F statistic.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conclusion - in context}

\pq{What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test?}

$\:$ \\

The data provide convincing evidence that the average aldrin concentration
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item  is different for all groups.

\item on the surface is lower than the other levels.

\solnMult{is different for at least one group.}

\item is the same for all groups.

\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}

\item  If p-value is small (less than $\alpha$), reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that at least one mean is different from (but we can't tell which one).

\pause

\item If p-value is large, fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide convincing evidence that at least one pair of means are different from each other, the observed differences in sample means are attributable to sampling variability (or chance).

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Multiple comparisons \& Type 1 error rate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Which means differ?}

\begin{itemize}

\item Earlier we concluded that at least one pair of means differ. The natural question that follows is ``which ones?"

\pause

\item We can do two sample $t$ tests for differences in each possible pair of groups.

\pause

\end{itemize}

\dq{Can you see any pitfalls with this approach?}

\pause

\begin{itemize}

\item When we run too many tests, the Type 1 Error rate increases.

\item This issue is resolved by using a modified significance level.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Multiple comparisons}

\begin{itemize}

\item The scenario of testing many pairs of groups is called \hl{multiple comparisons}.

\pause

\item The \hl{Bonferroni correction} suggests that a more \orange{stringent} significance level is more appropriate for these tests:

\[ \alpha^\star = \alpha / K \]

where $K$ is the number of comparisons being considered.

\pause

\item If there are $k$ groups, then usually all possible pairs are compared and $K = \frac{k (k - 1)}{2}$.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Determining the modified $\alpha$}

\pq{In the aldrin data set depth has 3 levels: bottom, mid-depth, and surface. If $\alpha = 0.05$, what should be the modified significance level for two sample $t$ tests for determining which pairs of groups have significantly different means?}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\alpha^* = 0.05$
\item $\alpha^* = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025$
\solnMult{$\alpha^* = 0.05 / 3 = 0.0167$}
\item $\alpha^* = 0.05 / 6 = 0.0083$
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Which means differ?}

\pq{Based on the box plots below, which means would you expect to be significantly different?}

\twocol{0.6}{0.4}{
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\chp7@path/7-5_anova/figures/aldrin/homo}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item bottom \& surface
\item bottom \& mid-depth
\item mid-depth \& surface
\item bottom \& mid-depth; mid-depth \& surface
\item bottom \& mid-depth; bottom \& surface; mid-depth \& surface
\end{enumerate}
}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Which means differ? (cont.)}

If the ANOVA assumption of equal variability across groups is satisfied, we can use the data from all groups to estimate variability:
    
\begin{itemize}

\item Estimate any within-group standard deviation with $\sqrt{MSE}$, which is $s_{pooled}$

\item Use the error degrees of freedom, $n - k$, for $t$-distributions

\end{itemize}

\formula{Difference in two means: after ANOVA}{
\[ SE = \sqrt{  \frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2} } \approx \sqrt{ \frac{MSE}{n_1} + \frac{MSE}{n_2} } \]
