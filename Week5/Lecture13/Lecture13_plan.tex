    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1 LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M2 LO1: Validate and Explain Probability Distributions:} Assess the validity of a probability distribution using the concepts of outcome, sample space, and probability properties (e.g., disjoint outcomes, probabilities between 0 and 1, and total probabilities summing to 1).
        \item \textbf{M2 LO4: Understand and Compute Expectations and Variances:} Explain the concepts of expectations and variances of random variables, and compute the expectation and variance of a linear combination of random variables.
        \item \textbf{M2 LO5: Model Data Using Bernoulli, Geometric, and Binomial Distributions:} Recognize when to appropriately model data using the Bernoulli, geometric, and binomial distributions, and compute quantities of interest such as mean, standard deviation, and tail probabilities.
