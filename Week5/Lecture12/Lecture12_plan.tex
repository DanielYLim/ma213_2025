    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1 LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M2 LO1: Validate and Explain Probability Distributions:} Assess the validity of a probability distribution using the concepts of outcome, sample space, and probability properties (e.g., disjoint outcomes, probabilities between 0 and 1, and total probabilities summing to 1).
        \item \textbf{M2 LO4: Understand and Compute Expectations and Variances:} Explain the concepts of expectations and variances of random variables, and compute the expectation and variance of a linear combination of random variables.
        \item \textbf{M2 LO5: Model Data Using Bernoulli, Geometric, and Binomial Distributions:} Recognize when to appropriately model data using the Bernoulli, geometric, and binomial distributions, and compute quantities of interest such as mean, standard deviation, and tail probabilities.

% TODO: Edfintiy quiz on bernoulli RVs
% TODO: Prepare board work for derivation of the Geometric distribution (using commented slide)
% TODO: Add slide showing the pmf as a formula, table, and picture. Add slide with the pmf picture, with visual indicator of the mean and +/- 1 std, +/- 2 std
% TODO: Edfinity quiz word problem for Geometric pmf (e.g. die roll example from sommented slide)
% TODO: Add a slide setting up the problem of computing the expected value of the geometric, using a table as we did before (but truncated) as well as the formula (with infinite sum). Point out that it is a complicated infinite sum, so we will give them the answer.
% TODO: R demo on sampling from Geometric
% TODO: Edfinity quiz on mean and variability for geometric
