        \item xx min Lecture: contingency tables
        \item xx min R demonstration: more examples of plots, proportions
        \item xx min Edfinity quiz (contingency tables)
        \item What else? % Not much material left in chapter/slides. Maybe merge this lecture with 3 or 5 and start Ch3 earlier?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Categorize variables based on their types (e.g., numerical/categorical, continuous/discrete, ordinal), assess their association (positive, negative, or independent), and determine which make sense as explanatory vs. response variables. [Q1, L2]
        \item Select appropriate visualizations (scatterplots, histograms, box plots, bar plots) to depict data, and describe distributions qualitatively (shape, center, spread, outliers) and quantitatively (mean, median, mode, range, IQR, standard deviation). [Q1, P1]
