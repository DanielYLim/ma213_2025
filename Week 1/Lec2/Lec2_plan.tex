    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO2: Evaluate Study Design and Its Implications:} Identify and explain experimental design choices (observational vs. experimental, sampling methods, blinding, potential biases), and judge whether results can be generalized to a population or used to infer causation. 
        \item \textbf{M1, LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M1, LO4: Visualize and Describe Data Distributions:} Select appropriate visualizations (scatterplots, histograms, box plots, bar plots) to depict data, and describe distributions qualitatively (shape, center, spread, outliers) and quantitatively (mean, median, mode, range, IQR, standard deviation).
