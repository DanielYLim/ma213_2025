    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.
        \item \textbf{M2, LO1: Validate and Explain Probability Distributions:} Assess the validity of a probability distribution using the concepts of outcome, sample space, and probability properties (e.g., disjoint outcomes, probabilities between 0 and 1, and total probabilities summing to 1).
        \item \textbf{M2, LO2: Apply the Law of Large Numbers and Its Implications:} Explain the Law of Large Numbers, why it holds, and its implications for predicting long-term averages in probability and statistics.
        \item \textbf{Compute Probabilities Using Various Tools:} Use logic, Venn diagrams, and probability rules to compute probabilities for events.
