    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M2, LO1: Validate and Explain Probability Distributions:} Assess the validity of a probability distribution using the concepts of outcome, sample space, and probability properties (e.g., disjoint outcomes, probabilities between 0 and 1, and total probabilities summing to 1).
        \item \textbf{M2, LO3: Compute Probabilities Using Various Tools:} Use logic, Venn diagrams, and probability rules to compute probabilities for events.
    \end{itemize}
