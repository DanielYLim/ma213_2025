    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{M1, LO1: Classify and Analyze Variables:} Categorize variables based on their types (e.g., numerical/categorical, continuous/discrete, ordinal), assess their association (positive, negative, or independent), and determine which make sense as explanatory vs. response variables.
        \item \textbf{M1, LO2: Evaluate Study Design and Its Implications:} Identify and explain experimental design choices (observational vs. experimental, sampling methods, blinding, potential biases), and judge whether results can be generalized to a population or used to infer causation. 
        \item \textbf{M1, LO3: Use R for Data Management and Exploration:} Utilize R to load, pre-process, and explore data through visualization and summarization techniques.

% TODO: Swap out gender for zodiac sign in the initial slides, match the variable names to the R demo
% TODO: Write a utility function to anonymize the Edfinity csv file and make the column names more descriptive (that the instructor will use before class)
% TODO: Find/make a question for the Edfinity quiz that asks students to distinguish between a population and a sample
% TODO: Deal with the text overflow on Slides 11, 13
